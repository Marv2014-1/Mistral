Solve a stabbing set problem on a dynamic set of intervals.

Hints: 

• fixed set of intervals: greedy
	– stab at the earliest end-point
	– sort by ends and solve in O(n)
• dynamic set of intervals
	– simulate the greedy process
	– blocks of size 𝑛 (by ends)
	– jump within a block
• compute the end of the greedy process within a block for every start
	– jump between blocks
	– min end among those with sufficiently large start
	– 𝑂(𝑛 𝑛 log 𝑛), TLE
• exploit known coordinates
	– for every interval precompute the “next” (could be inactive) interval within each block
	– enable/disable intervals, update suffix min query data
	– 𝑂 𝑛 𝑛 time and space, MLE
• process queries (different times) “in parallel” from block to block
	– final interval for each “time”
	– sort intervals by starts within a block
	– compute next intervals for current block
		• recompute block on change
		• suffix min data, final positions within block
	– 𝑂 𝑛 𝑛 time, 𝑂 𝑛 space
